***Noone is going to track you. This is a legal developer feature that we are using through the Telegram public API***
***AND YES. You get added to the channel that you are reporting. But you are an observer, can't post there or get associated with it in any way.***

* run  python reper.py -r 1000 -t yurasumy -m child_abuse
* make some tea or coffee
* run python reper.py -r 1000 -t dnepr_partizani -m child_abuse
* at this point the last command can be repeated. we are looking for more channels. The parameter that is 1000 is the times that we report the channel. the name of the channel is after -t and the last part of the command is the criteria by which we report it.
Every report has a message coded into it which reads: "This channel is a Russian propoganda channel, spreading misinformation AND TACTICAL POSITION OF UKRAINIAN FORCES to the Russian military."

The last parameter (the criteria) can also be changed to 'violence', so you can replace 'child_abuse'
